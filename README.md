A front end website template made with:
 - [jQuery](https://jquery.com/)
 - [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
 - [Owl Carousel](https://owlcarousel2.github.io/OwlCarousel2/)
 - [Wow.js](https://wowjs.uk/)
 - [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/v4.7.0/)
 - etc.

I made this after a [tutorial](https://www.udemy.com/build-modern-responsive-website-with-html5-css3-bootstrap/), I took at my first job as a web developer.
